# Movie_search_project

Hello, this gem is a gem that allows you to see what movies are trending today, based off the MovieDB api I used. You should be able to run the gem and it will prompt you to hit the 'enter' key for the trending movies to appear, next it will ask you which movie you want to know more about and you just simply type the nubmer of the movie in the list to get some additional information.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Movie_search_project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Movie_search_project

## Usage

Just hit enter and type in the number of the movie you wish to know more about.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
